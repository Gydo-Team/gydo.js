## Contribution Guidelines

## Submitting a Pull Request

Make sure everything works, meaning to always do testings, of course.
the PR should be something that would be useful for the users.

### Git Commits

- Commits should use past tense (e.g. `add some feature`)
- If you are working on the typings, it should have `[typings]` before the actual commit message
