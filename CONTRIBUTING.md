## Contribution Guidelines

## Submitting a Pull Request

Make sure everything works, meaning to always do testings, of course.
the PR should be something that would be useful for the users.

Changes description should be simple, if possible.

Also make sure you add JSDoc comments for things you've added, if needed.

Example:

```js
class Something {
    /**
     * Description here
     * @param {any} param
     */
    constructor(param) {}
}
```

[See more about JSDoc Comments here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html)

### Git Commits

- Commits should use past tense (e.g. `add some feature`)
- If you are working on the typings, it should have `[typings]` before the actual commit message
- Make it simple
